# soggy.cat
**wet?** nope, more like **soggy**.
**cat?** it's a **cat** for sure!

this website was made as a joke and was supposed to be similar to https://bigrat.monster.
someone joked about starting a gofundme to gain money to buy this domain. i took it as a challenge and decided to create it, and after just a few hours FP donated to it!
the gofundme servers are like built with scratch.mit.edu so many problems occured. i had to help FP a lot because he accepted to try to setup the domain itself. in the end, i actually got full access to the domain and everything succeeded.
